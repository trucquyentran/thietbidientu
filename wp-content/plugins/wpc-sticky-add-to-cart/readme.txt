WPC Sticky Add To Cart brings about a nicer, customer-friendly sticky add-to-cart bar for your site.

== Description ==

One among the most common elements that can bring about a nicer, customer-friendly experience for eCommerce sites is to use the Sticky Add to Cart. This is to prepare for a more convenient and faster checkout while browsing the store. Many studies have shown that using a sticky add to cart can improve the conversion rate, boost the sales while also facilitating the user experience in online shopping.

**WPC Sticky Add to Cart** displays a button that is always on standby on the screen so that customers can easily add products to the cart while scrolling around the page. Especially, when browsing through a long list of products, customers don’t have to scroll back to the top to find the Add to Cart button but instead, it’s always within easy reach.

Though it’s a type of Call to Action, the sticky add to cart button won’t interfere with customers while navigating around as users can choose where to put it on their site. Buyers can preview the item as there will be a thumbnail, price, quantity input, and press the Add to Cart button whenever they want.
